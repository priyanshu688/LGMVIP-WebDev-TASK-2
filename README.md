# LGMVIP-WebDev-TASK-2

This project is created as my 2nd Task. This Repository contains the code of Web-Application which is designed using CREATE-REACT-APP. Here I have designed a Navbar on the top which shows any Brand name and added a Button saying "GET USERS" which nakes an API call to get the user data
